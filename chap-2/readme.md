# Practice Questions

### 1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

- &ensp; **True** &ensp;-> &ensp; Starts with a capital T with the rest of the word in lowercase with no single or double quotes.
- &ensp; **False** -> &ensp; Starts with a capital T with the rest of the word in lowercase with no single or double quotes.
### 2. What are the three Boolean operators?

### 3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

### 4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
```python
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

```
### 5. What are the six comparison operators?

### 6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

### 7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.

### 8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
```python
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')
```
### 9. Write code that prints `Hello` if `1` is stored in `spam`, prints `Howdy` if `2` is stored in `spam`, and prints `Greetings!` if anything else is stored in `spam`.

### 10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

### 11. What is the difference between `break` and `continue`?

### 12. What is the difference between `range(10)`, `range(0, 10)`, and `range(0, 10, 1)` in a for `loop`?

### 13. Write a short program that prints the numbers `1` to `10` using a `for` loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers `1` to `10` using a `while` loop.

### 14. If you had a function named `bacon()` inside a module named `spam`, how would you call it after importing `spam`?
